            <h5>Matt Stanford</h5>
            <h6><em>Broker</em></h6>
            <p>matt@stanfordgroupseattle.com <span>|</span></p>

        <p>Having been a lifelong Seattleite, Matt has witnessed the amazing growth this city has experienced, and from
            an early age, he wanted to be part of it. Matt has always been drawn to construction projects, the art of
            building, and specifically how people live in their homes or workplace.</p>

        <p> After completing school at St. Joseph’s Elementary School, Blanchet High School, and Gonzaga University,
            Matt moved overseas for three years to play professional basketball. In 1995, he moved back to Seattle and
            began a 20-year career in the construction industry. Matt started as a project manager for a high-end custom
            remodeling company, then owned a house flipping business, and eventually became a general contractor,
            helping homeowners turn their existing house into their dream home. Each and every experience of either
            developing his own investment property or helping homeowner’s ideas become a reality, provided him with a
            unique understanding of all facets of home-ownership. These experiences have dovetailed nicely into helping
            clients purchase and sell homes.</p>

        <p>Matt has a detailed understanding of costs associated with remodeling projects, a keen eye for design
            possibilities and expansion concepts, and broad-based knowledge of the mechanical aspects related to homes.
            This knowledge has proven to be key in helping clients make astute decisions when contemplating taking on a
            “fixer” house, or just making sense of a home inspection report. He enjoys guiding clients through this
            process so they can make a sound financial decision.</p>

        <p> In addition to being a real estate broker, Matt has a variety of other interests as well. He loves being
            outside spending time on/in the water either fishing, surfing, or boating with his wife Stephanie, son
            Jackson, daughter Sidney, and their French bulldog Felix.</p>
