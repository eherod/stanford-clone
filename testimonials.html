            “To start, the title of this review should be - “I felt like my realtor was my family member”. We are first
            time home buyers. We met Stephanie in an open house viewing (she was representing the seller) during our
            preliminary search (we were not ready to buy at that stage). We had contacted several agents to help us with
            the search and never got a good vibe (either too pushy, or not getting what we wanted but wanted to force
            opinions to us). Stephanie was the exact opposite of that! Additionally, the best added bonus was that her
            business partner/husband Matt, has extensive experience with construction. Both are super personable,
            extremely knowledgeable, answer every question of a first time home buyer with a smile. I felt that I had my
            family there with me, guiding me through, with only my interest in mind. We ended up pulling the trigger
            much earlier when we found the place that was the dream for us. We were not fully underwritten, we had to
            make an offer within 24 hours and we didn’t want to lose the place. Matt and Stephanie took over everything,
            from communicating with lenders, advising us on the offer, talking to the seller and negotiating, inspecting
            the house and in the next 3 hours, our underwriting was already in process, the offer we made was accepted,
            and the dream home was ours. Throughout the 30 days till close, both of them visited the house multiple
            times, Matt would flag things to the seller that needed to be fixed. He had the foresight to ask for
            inspection of the sewer pipes and he found out about a major blockage that in order to be fixed it would
            have cost us a lot of money. He took over once again the negotiations with the seller and he managed to
            convince them that it needed to be fixed prior to close and they did! I really don’t know if we would have
            been able to do this without their incredible sense of responsibility and putting their customer first. To
            sum up once again, if a family member isn’t a real estate agent, then you have just found the right people
            that would make you feel exactly that! I couldn’t recommend them more highly and I’m so thankful for all
            they have done for us. Truly phenomenal professionals but most of all human beings.”

            “Zillow helped us get connected to Stephanie with a somewhat whimsical viewing of a house down the street of
            our previous place, and a few weeks later, we had an offer in on our first home! As first-time home buyers,
            our ignorance and uncertainty was high, and Stephanie and Matt helped us navigate that journey, helping to
            answer all questions along the way and with patience. Stephanie was great at being able to provide a wide
            range of various houses within our range/desired location, which helped us really gain clarity on what we
            were actually looking for in our property. We really appreciated how attentive they were to our needs and
            concerns and worked to make sure all aspects were addressed as we moved through the closing process. Matt
            was there during the entire inspection walking us through the ins-and-outs of various pieces of the house
            and advising on ways we could address or improve or just giving general advice for a first-time home buyer
            on how to maintain or upkeep various pieces. It was a joy to get to work with them both. Overall, I would
            happily enlist Stephanie and Matt again and am thankful that we had them to help use navigate and gain
            confidence and excitement in our big decision as the process completed.”</p>

        <p> “I cannot say enough good things about Matt and Stephanie. They are true professionals in their field and
            just good folk through and through. We were able to quickly establish trust relationship and through the
            entire home buying process, they made me feel like family. They did this by showing tremendous respect
            towards not just myself, but towards the other agents, my lender, and all the other wonderful people we had
            the pleasure of working with throughout this process. For the home I wound up in, they recognized the
            urgency and helped me get both a showing and an offer in within just four hours of listing! I could not be
            happier with my home purchase. Thank you Matt and Stephanie!”</p>

        <p class="testimonial-names"> — Adrienne</p>

        <p> “Matt and Stephanie are incredible! As first time home buyers we entered the process not knowing what to
            expect, and having heard some horror stories from friends buying in the area. I can attest that Matt and
            Stephanie made the entire process anything but difficult! They are true professionals that surpassed all of
            our expectations.

            We made an offer on a Friday night and they went straight into buy mode working late in order to jump on the
            opportunity. Throughout the month to follow they guided us through everything we needed to do and what to
            expect, demystifying the process and honestly making it enjoyable.

            With a background in residential construction, Matt was able to coordinate remodeling we wanted to get done
            before moving. We were sort of dumbstruck because it was way beyond our expectations and showed how much he
            truly cares.

            I absolutely recommend working with Matt and Stephanie, it’s the smartest thing you could do when it comes
            to getting help buying your home.”</p>

        <p>“Matt and Stephanie go above and beyond. I bought my second home this year and finally found the right home
            after many months. Matt is knowledgeable, flexible, and patient. He is always willing to answer questions
            and do more research. His knowledge of how homes are constructed as well as electrical and plumbing systems
            are invaluable to a buyer. During my extensive search for a home, Matt was always willing to listen to what
            I was looking for and put in the time to show me the right homes. Stephanie did a thorough job of explaining
            the paperwork. They are a great team and I highly recommend them. They will be listing my previous home and
            have done a wonderful job of helping me prepare for that listing.”

        <p>“As first time home buyers, my fiancé and I were incredibly excited but also pretty nervous to look for a
            home in the Seattle area because the market is so competitive. To say that Matt and Stephanie were helpful
            would be a massive understatement. They sourced great homes for us to look at that were well within our
            budget. Matt took a detailed look at each of the houses we toured and was quick to point out things that
            were off about the homes we were looking at. We found this really helpful because we didn’t know the beyond
            the surface things to be on the lookout for. The house that we wanted of course it had an offer on it. Matt
            and Stephanie wasted no time talking about how we were going to negotiate the deal and were quick to get the
            offer out. After the inspection, they both advocated for us and all of the terms that we wanted were
            accepted. Besides their professionalism, they both made the experience of buying a first home personal and
            meaningful. 10/10 would recommend to anyone new to the home buying process or Seattle area.”</p>
