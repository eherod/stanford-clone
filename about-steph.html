            <h5>Stephanie Stanford</h5>
            <h6><em>Broker</em></h6>

        <p>Over the last 15 years, Stephanie has been involved in many real estate transactions in the Greater Seattle
            area. She takes immense pride in guiding her clients through the process of buying or selling their home,
            always providing them with a comprehensive understanding of local market values, delivering a high level of
            service, and most importantly being their trusted advocate.</p>

        <p>Born and raised in the Seattle area, she is proud to call herself a true Seattle Native! She attended both
            public and private schools in and around Seattle and received a Bachelors degree from Washington State
            University after spending three years at the University of San Francisco. After graduating, she returned to
            Seattle, worked in both retail and technology for many years, eventually married, and had two children.</p>

        <p>Her initial interest in real estate started soon after her marriage to her husband, Matt. Together they
            bought their first home in 1999 and spent whatever "free" time they had building sweat equity with the help
            of his general contractor background. In a matter of five years, they had purchased and sold three homes,
            turning a profit each time. In 2005, she obtained her broker license because she wanted to help others
            navigate the real estate world and realize their own successes.</p>

        <p>She has watched Seattle grow from a small city to a now bustling, metropolitan, international community. All
            the growth has created a challenging market due to a large buyer pool and a lack of inventory. This is why
            it is so important to work with an agent who thinks outside the box, is familiar with neighborhoods,
            transportation, schools, commute times, current market trends, can negotiate a deal, and all that a real
            estate transaction entails. </p>

        <p>When she is not selling or buying real estate, she loves spending time with her family, friends, and her
            French bulldog, Felix.</p>
