        <main class="about-steph__main">
            <p class="about-steph-main__p">Over the last 15 years, Stephanie has been involved in many real estate
                transactions
                in the Greater Seattle
                area. She takes immense pride in guiding her clients through the process of buying or selling their
                home,
                always providing them with a comprehensive understanding of local market values, delivering a high level
                of
                service, and most importantly being their trusted advocate.</p>

            <p class="about-steph-main__p">Born and raised in the Seattle area, she is proud to call herself a true
                Seattle Native! She attended
                both
                public and private schools in and around Seattle and received a Bachelors degree from Washington State
                University after spending three years at the University of San Francisco. After graduating, she returned
                to
                Seattle, worked in both retail and technology for many years, eventually married, and had two children.
            </p>

            <p class="about-steph-main__p">Her initial interest in real estate started soon after her marriage to her
                husband, Matt. Together they
                bought their first home in 1999 and spent whatever "free" time they had building sweat equity with the
                help
                of his general contractor background. In a matter of five years, they had purchased and sold three
                homes,
                turning a profit each time. In 2005, she obtained her broker license because she wanted to help others
                navigate the real estate world and realize their own successes.</p>

            <p class="about-steph-main__p">She has watched Seattle grow from a small city to a now bustling,
                metropolitan, international community.
                All
                the growth has created a challenging market due to a large buyer pool and a lack of inventory. This is
                why
                it is so important to work with an agent who thinks outside the box, is familiar with neighborhoods,
                transportation, schools, commute times, current market trends, can negotiate a deal, and all that a real
                estate transaction entails. </p>

            <p class="about-steph-main__p">When she is not selling or buying real estate, she loves spending time with
                her family, friends, and her
                French bulldog, Felix.</p>
